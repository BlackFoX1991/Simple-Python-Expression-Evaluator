First, we will run Tokenizer.py, which creates a token container holding numbers and operators. Then, we will run Interpreter.py to process these tokens. The interpreter works by first looking for a term, then a factor, then an exponential, and finally a number or another expression in parentheses.

This approach provides a solid foundation for building a custom programming language.
