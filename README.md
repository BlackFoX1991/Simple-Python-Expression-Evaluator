# Simple-Python-Expression-Evaluator

First, we run Tokenizer.py, which generates a token container holding numbers, operators, and other symbols. Next, we run Interpreter.py to process these tokens. The interpreter evaluates expressions using a recursive descent approach: it first parses terms, then factors, followed by exponentials, and finally numbers or nested expressions in parentheses.

This structured parsing strategy provides a solid foundation for implementing a custom programming language.
